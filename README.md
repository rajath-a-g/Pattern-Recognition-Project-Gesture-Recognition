# Pattern-Recognition-Project-Gesture-Recognition
The official project code is posted here.
I have taken some code from https://github.com/Gogul09/gesture-recognition where the segmentation of the hand has been done in an intuitive manner.

# Requirements to run this project
1) numpy
2) imutils
3) Python3.6.7
4) tensorflow
5) sklearn
6) tklearn

# How to run
Run the segment.py first wait for about 10 seconds and then press 'c' and then run the recognise.py to count the number of fingers.
Run the Palmtracer.py if you want to add a custome data set and then run the ModelTrainer.ipnyb to train the model. Then run the ContinuousGesturePredictor.py, even here you need to wait for 10 seconds before showing the gestures.
